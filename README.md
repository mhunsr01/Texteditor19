# Texteditor19
Texteditor19 is another editor that highlights javascript coding

# What is it
Uses indexDB, js, nodejs, cdd, html, and is a full stack downloadable app.

# Explanation
Very simply the user installs the app, opens it from the desktop, and can begin writing. If the user opens the app from the web, the database seems to still work and maintains the information.  So when the use reopens the desktop app, the information is still there.

# Coder
Code was provided to begin this project, and the coder is Matthew Hunter, with the app available at                     and the guthub repository at https://github.com/mhunsr01/Texteditor19.
